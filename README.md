# What is this?

This is a tool I (Tony Zheng) created to perform quick-and-dirty analysis of Android smartphones on the market.
The goal is to find the best bang for your buck when it comes to phone performance.
It uses Antutu, a mobile benchmarking app, and Ebay's Browse API to get "street prices" of phones.

# How can I use this?

You will need to sign-up for Ebay's developer program to generate a user token.
You can do that [here](https://developer.ebay.com/).
The results are outputted to a csv file for convenience.

# Should I use this to make my next smartphone purchase decision?

Maybe. Use it as a starting point.
This tool only considers a phone's Antutu score which is not a one-to-one measurement of real world performance.
There are also many other factors like camera, build quality, battery life, software experience to consider.

Furthermore, while I have done my best at filtering out inaccurate Ebay search results, it is not a perfect methodology.
For example, the phone Mi 8 has a Lite version, which happens to be what the first search result is.
